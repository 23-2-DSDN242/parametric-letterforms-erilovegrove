Each of my letters is made of:

- two C shaped curves. One is fixed in place vertically while the other can move up and down, as well as change direction. The diameters of these curves can be shrunk to 0. They are utilised in letters like B, D and S.
The parameters that control the curves are:
  * `arcdiameter1` : diameter or arc 1
  * `arcdiameter` : diameter of arc 2
  * `arcdirection` : direction of arc 2 (facing left or facing right)
  * `arc1xposition` : x position of arc 1
  * `arc2xposition` : x position of arc 2
  * `arc2yposition` : y position of arc 2


- two half C shaped curves. They are fixed in place but can be shrunk to 0. They are utilised in letters like A and numbers like 2 to slightly curve the top line into the two vertical supporting lines.
The parameters that control these curves are:
  * `smallarcdiameter` : diameter of both arcs

- 1 vertical line. This line can move vertically but is stuck in place horizontally. 
The parameters that control the curves are:
  * `line4length` : length of the line
  * `line4yposition` : starting position of the line

- 1 horizontal line. This line can move vertically and horizontally but can not rotate to be a vertical line. 
The parameters that control the curves are:
  * `arcdiameter1` : diameter or arc 1
  * `arcdiameter` : diameter of arc 2
  * `arcdirection` : direction of arc 2 (facing left or facing right)
  * `arc1xposition` : x position of arc 1
  * `arc2xposition` : x position of arc 2
  * `arc2yposition` : y position of arc 2

- 2 versatile lines. These two lines can be diagonal, horizontal or vertical.

The parameters that control the curves are:
  * `arcdiameter1` : diameter or arc 1
  * `arcdiameter` : diameter of arc 2
  * `arcdirection` : direction of arc 2 (facing left or facing right)
  * `arc1xposition` : x position of arc 1
  * `arc2xposition` : x position of arc 2
  * `arc2yposition` : y position of arc 2


Talk about process

include screenshots

talk bout what hoad to change, including the sharing of the ine1x of both lines because of constraints. How you needed to make one more line versatile to be a diagonal.
